# AI and Euthanasia

## Script 1: Simulates AI disinformation impact on Euthanasia public opinion

#### Uses pre-trained GPT-2 models from the Hugging Face transformers library to generate responses to given prompts/questions.

- Function: The generate_response function encodes prompts, generates responses, and decodes them into human-readable text.
- Model Initialization: It initializes GPT-2 models of different sizes (base, medium, large) along with their tokenizers for comparison.
- Response Generation Loop: For each prompt, responses are generated using all three models, simulating AI-generated misinformation impact on public opinion regarding euthanasia.
- Output: The script prints the questions and the responses generated by each model for comparison.

## Script 2: Simulates AI-Assisted Euthanasia
